General:
- All-new and more immersive music

- Added a quest to return to your lord after freelancer army is defeated
- Added ability to request for promotion from ashigaru to samurai in freelancer with enough renown and relationship
- Added agents/ninja -- crude and limited for now (they only help you open castle walls)
- AI now form basic formations in battle -- not quite like other mods, but should be slightly improved over vanilla
- Added limited seafaring (sea routes are restricted) and new sea battle maps based on relative army sizes
- Added "forts" -- self-contained castles/hideouts with no income but free storage and recruitables

Scripting:
- Added the last of the 1.143 -> 1.153 fixes I missed
- Added the code that turned 1.153 -> 1.158
- Frequent lord_get_home_center errors are now fixed

- Added Lord Kakizaki as a vassal of the Nanbu, who controls the only castle in Ezo (Hokkaido)
- Kaga Ikki are now called Ikko Ikki because they now have territories outside of Kaga
- Ikko Ikki monks are recruited from temple fortresses and Kanazawa, Ikko samurai volunteers from castles, and villagers from villages -- they now have the most varied troop tree
- Village recruits are now named after regions rather than clans, but all other troop names remain the same. This is to emphasize their initial loyalty to the land rather than their lord

- Renamed certain companions to be less obnoxious about videogame references

- Changed the name and backstory of some pretenders
- The faction name now changes when certain pretenders win (Tokugawa -> Imagawa for example)

- Loading screens are now minimalist (only one figure rather than three)

Known Bugs
----------
- Heraldic sashimono sometimes do not trigger properly (solid color)
- Certain lords with custom jinbaori do not have indoor clothing (and are thus naked)
- There are still one or two references to medieval europe in the dialogue that were missed
- A couple of the arrow flight meshes are oversized
(These aren't the only known bugs, these are the only known bugs that consistently happen)

Version 2.1a Hotfix
-------------------
- Fixed a freelancer bug where being a gunner for a lord did not give you a gun
- Fixed a major issue with how faction diplomatic status was tracked, causing factions on opposite sides of the map to declare war on each other, as well as other insanities
- Because of the fix above, diplomatic triggers have been restored to every 24 hours from every 96 hours

It is advised (but not completely necessary) to start a new game to see the changes in faction diplomacy
If you are a gunner without a gun, you will not receive one in your current save until you are promoted again

Version 2.1 Changes
-------------------
- Proper credit to Bogmir for his Yari and Yumi models -- Sorry for forgetting I still had those!
- Caba`drin's Pre-Battle Orders v0.8 should now be integrated into the mod. I chose not to use the full PBOD so that WSE would not be required
- Enabled volley fire by command, advanced formations, and increased weapon usage orders
- Enabled crouching
- Minor scene fixes to several towns, castles, and villages
- Fixed Yamagata castle not having the correct scene file installed
- Created LODs for Polished Landscape meshes -- maps should have better performance now
- Changed the collision meshes for plants so you don't get stopped by rocks or bushes (or skeletons) anymore
- Gekokujo now properly loads one Polished Landscape brf that I had forgotten to load before
- Replaced 49 cloned banners with all-new unique ones
- All lords should now have unique banners (must start a new game to take effect)

- All 11 pages of banners should be selectable now, not just the first 8

- Faction diplomacy now updates every 4 days instead of every day to increase performance and make the world less hectic
- Tweaked diplomatic AI to take shared borders into account when declaring war

Installation
------------
If you have an old version -- delete it first! 3.0 will overwrite all old files as necessary, but it will leave a few behind that are no longer used.

3.0 comes in two versions: a self-extracting installer that auto-detects your warband directory and a .rar for power users who know what they're doing.

If you have the installer, just run it and follow the instructions.

If you have the .rar, extract it into your modules directory.

Gekokujo
--------
Gekokujo is a mod for Mount and Blade Warband set in the Sengoku period of Japan. The name is a term often translated as "the low-ranked taking over from the high" and was chosen because it was a running theme during that era: Oda Nobunaga descended from a clan of deputies to the nominal governor of their province, but the Oda usurped them and toppled their neighbors; Toyotomi Hideyoshi began his career as a cook and sandal bearer and ended up the ruler of Japan; Tokugawa Ieyasu was an upstart who probably fabricated a claim of descent from the Minamoto clan--the only ones allowed to be granted the title of Shogun. As a player of Gekokujo, you will start from nothing and attempt to gain control of the entire country, making the title fitting.

A little note on the in-game names of equipment and NPCs: My priority is to make the mod intuitive for all players, not just historical enthusiasts, so gratuitous Japanese is avoided, unless the English equivalent is even more cumbersome or somehow less informative. You will also meet "Lord Tokugawa", not "Daimyo Tokugawa Ieyasu" -- in Native mount and blade, lords only had one name (although their given names, not their surnames or house names), and "Daimyo _" isn't accurate usage anyway, since it's not how anyone would have addressed them. The mod tries to be accurate with regards to the general conditions of the time, but deliberately ignores particulars as a design decision. "Lord Oda" represents Nobunaga, but isn't really him. Gekokujo is not a historical simulation, but not because I believe it detracts from gameplay or enjoyment--so although it won't be perfect, I am not going out of my way to flout history and accuracy.

Current Features
----------------
- New map of Japan with more than double the playable area of Native, from Kyushu in the south to Ezo (Hokkaido) in the north
- 32 towns (10 more than native!), 75 castles (28 more than native!!), and 164 villages (54 more than native!!!)
- New village, castle, town, tavern, and many other scenes

- New weapons, armor, trade goods, flags, and other details appropriate for the time and place
- Gunpowder weapons and gunpowder units
- New faces and hairs, including 6 base asian male and 4 base asian female faces
- 20 factions (19 samurai clans plus the Ikko-Ikki movement of monks, peasants, and samurai volunteers)
- Tested for stability and consistency so that it has, at minimum, the playability level of Native
- Town and castle recruitment (villages for ashigaru, towns and castles for samurai, temple fortresses for monks)
- Bodyguards for interior scenes (requires NPC companions and high-enough reknown or nobility)
- Tweaked startup scripts to increase variety in new games (such as the relationships of noble lords and ladies with each other)
- Integrated Freelancer mod (ask to serve a samurai lord as a direct retainer and participate in all their battles)
- Integrated Diplomacy mod (many, many features -- look them up separately)
- 22 npcs will full-fledged backstories
- Many, many more!

Upcoming Features
-----------------
- Improved graphics
- Better warcries
- Localizations in many languages
- A religion system
- Parallel faction systems for merchants and bandits, meant to complement each other and the territorial lords
- More quests (with many based on the merchant, bandit, and religious factions)

Code
----
The module system code is included with this release. This is for people who know what they are doing -- I will direct most coding questions to the taleworlds modding forums, unless it's a question specific to the code of Gekokujo rather than coding in general.

Make whatever sub-mods you want using this code. The only thing I ask of you is to release whatever you make in the gekokujo thread (or subforum) in the taleworlds forums.
